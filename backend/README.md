## Getting Started

You'll need the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

```
STYTCH_SECRET=secret-test-hAIaTPryTDo8mQ2FYvZ3FYxFW8AKPXFc12E=
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID=project-test-f20beceb-df7a-4d62-a156-40677b69480f
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npx nodemon start
```

The server will start at `localhost:5000`.
